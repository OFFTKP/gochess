This is a toy WIP chess engine in Go. Come back later ðŸ‘· :construction:

## Project goals
### Test driven development
This project is made with the intention of learning more about unit tests and [test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).    
This means that development will be slower at the start, with the benefit of easy regression detection later on, when we start optimizing.
### Chess engines
I get to learn more stuff about chess engines.
### Go
Go may not be the best language for such a performance dependent program, but this is a toy project and this is a good chance to learn Go.
